excerpt: "About the Author"

 Having Social Sciences (Organizational Psychology) as academic background, I discovered the amazing world of software development in 2007. Since then I´ve been a coder 24/7. When I´m working I´m coding and when I´m relaxing I´m probably coding.

 In 2009 started an Informatics and Computer Engineering degree witch had to be put on hold. I will definitely get back to that soon…

 I try to permanently stay in touch with the latest technologies and features, so I´m always trying to learn something new and trying to evolve as a software developer. This blog is an attempt of sharing and documenting my coding experiences and some thoughts about software development.

 This is a space mainly dedicated to the .Net world but not exclusively…

 Among the technologies/subjects that forces me to open the browser and spend hours in front of any “device” (books included… yes, paper…) that can provide information are:

- TDD
- Clean Code
- Asp Mvc
- node.js
- Web Api
- SignalR
- WPF
- Windows Phone
- Angular.js
- Twitter Bootstrap
- Unity
